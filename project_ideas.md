# Project Ideas

1. Beginner: Simple Calculator - Create a basic calculator that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and
   division operations.
2. Beginner: Guess the Number Game - Develop a program that generates a random number and prompts the user to guess it.
   Provide hints to help the user narrow down their guess.
3. Intermediate: Weather App - Build a weather application that retrieves real-time weather data from an API and
   displays it to the user. Include features like temperature, humidity, and weather conditions.
4. Intermediate: To-Do List - Create a command-line to-do list application that allows users to add, delete, and view
   tasks. Implement features like due dates and priority levels.
5. Intermediate: Image Recognition - Utilize machine learning libraries like TensorFlow or OpenCV to develop an image
   recognition program that can identify objects or classify images.
6. Advanced: Chatbot - Design a chatbot that can engage in conversations with users, answer questions, and provide
   relevant information. Implement natural language processing techniques to improve its responses.
7. Advanced: Stock Market Analysis - Develop a program that retrieves stock market data from an API and performs
   analysis on it. Implement features like calculating moving averages, identifying trends, and generating
   visualizations.
8. Advanced: Web Scraper - Build a web scraper that extracts data from websites and stores it in a structured format.
   Use libraries like BeautifulSoup or Scrapy to navigate and scrape web pages.
9. Advanced: Recommendation System - Create a recommendation system that suggests items to users based on their
   preferences or past behavior. Use techniques like collaborative filtering or content-based filtering to generate
   personalized recommendations.
10. Advanced: Neural Network for Image Classification - Implement a neural network using deep learning frameworks like
    TensorFlow or PyTorch to classify images. Train the network on a large dataset and evaluate its accuracy on test
    images.
